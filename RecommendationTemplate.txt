Hi shivam, hoping this message finds you in good health. I'm just updating my linkedin profile.

So can you please do me a gand write few kinds words about the experience you had
working with me. Please do mention about the skills which you feel i am good in (soft skill and technical both :) 

Thanking you in advance.

By the way things which i felt good working with you was your down to earth nature, politeness and you were a great mentor from whom i learned a lot, never felt like a employee and a employer relationship while working with you. Last but not the least your nature was too good.
